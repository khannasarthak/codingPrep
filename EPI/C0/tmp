KFORCE INTERNATIONAL STAFFING - JR SECURITY ANALYST - TEMPE, AZ

Hi Sarthak, 

I am currently looking for a jr security analyst for a major financial employer in Tempe, AZ. If you have recently graduated from Arizona State University with a background in computer science and specifically cyber security will make an excellent fit.

Please email me resume and please include in email when your opt authorization begins. 

The role is short term in duration, but can be a great opportunity for the right individual.
F1 student visa is no problem as well. 

Based on the information reflected in your LinkedIn profile, I would like to speak to you about expanding your career with Kforce. A little about me: I finished at the top of my class in high school, graduated from a top 20 University here in the United States, and recently completed my MBA about a year ago. I have dedicated my career to connecting individuals with the right opportunity for them. I promise to have your best interests at heart – the reason I show up to work everyday is because I truly believe that Kforce provides exceptional value for H1B and foreign national consultants. I won’t try to fit you into rigid requirements, but will work to understand exactly what you are looking for – both in terms of your career, but also your visa-based needs.
